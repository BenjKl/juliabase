"""This module is the connection to the database.  It contains the *models*,
i.e. Python classes which represent the tables in the relational database.
Every class which inherits from ``models.Model`` is a PostgreSQL table at the
same time, unless it has ``abstract = True`` set in their ``Meta`` subclass.

If you add fields to models, and you have a PostgreSQL database running which
contains already valuable data, you have to add the fields manually with SQL
commands to the database, too, or use Django-South.

However, if you add new *classes*, you can just run ``./manage.py syncdb`` and
the new tables are automatically created.

Note that this module doesn't define any models itself.  It is only the
container where all models are finally brought together by module inclusion.
The number and complexity of Chantal's models is too big for one file.
Therefore, we have a few model modules, all starting with ``models_...`` and
residing in this directory.  With ``from samples.models_... import *``
I can give the rest of Chantal's modules the illusion that all models are
actually here.
