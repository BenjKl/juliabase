About this document
===================================

This document explains JuliaBase for the programmer.  It is a technical overview
of the whole architecture.  Moreover, it is a guide for adapting JuliaBase to a
new institute, research department, or scientific group.

If you want to read this manual, you should be familiar with several
technologies:

1.  *Python*.  You should have advanced experience in this language.  This
    includes the standard library; you should at least know what it can do and
    how to find information about it.

2.  *Django*.  You must have mastered the tutorial of the Django web framework.

3.  *HTML*.  Basic knowledge should be enough.


Architecture
====================

Since JuliaBase is based on the Django Web framework, it consists of several
Django apps.  The core app is called “jb_common”.  It provides
functionality which is essential for all JuliaBase components.  On top of that,
the app “samples” contains all features of a samples database.  However, it
does not contain institute-specific code in order to remain generic and
flexible.  This institute-specific code resides in an app of its own and must
be created by a skilled programmer.
