Installation
==============

Prerequisites
===============

Basically, you only need the current version of the `Django web framework`_
together with its prerequisites.  Typically, this will be a computer with a
Linux operating system, and with Apache and PostgreSQL running on it.  However,
Django is flexible.  Is also runs on a Windows server, and it may be combined
with different webservers and database backends.  See `Django's own
installation guide`_ for more information.  Still, in this document, we assume
the default setup, which we also strongly recommend: Linux, Apache, PostgreSQL.
We deliberately avoid mentioning any particular Linux distribution because we
assume that at least their server flavours are similar enough.  For what it's
worth, the authors run Ubuntu Server.

.. _Django's own installation guide:
   https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/install/

Mostly, no sophisticated finetuning of the components is necessary because
JuliaBase deployments will serve only a few (< 1000) people.  In particular,
PostgreSQL and Apache can run in default configuration by and large.  On the
other hand, the computer should be a `high-availability system`_, possibly
realised with virtual machines.  In our own installation, we manage a
three-nines system, i. e. 99.9 % availability.  Additionally, regular backups
are a must! To set up these things, however, is beyond the scope of this
document.  Your IT department may turn out to be very helpful with this.

In the following, we'll show you how to get JuliaBase up and running quickly.
While our way is already useful for a production system, you may wish or need
to do it in a different way.  Thus, consider the following a good starting
point for your own configuration.

Linux configuration
=======================

Additionally to the software that is running on any recent and decent Linux
operating system by default anyway, you must install:

- Apache2
- PostgreSQL (and the Python module “psycopg2” for it)
- memcached (and the Python module for it)
- matplotlib
- reportlab
- Dejavu fonts

PostgreSQL
==============

If you have PostgreSQL and Apache on the same computer, PostgreSQL's default
configuration should work for you.  The defaults are quite restrictive, so they
can be considered secure.  Otherwise, if you need to change something, it is
probably in pg_hba.conf (where the `user authentication`_ resides) or
postgresql.conf (where the `general configuration`_ resides), both of which are
typically found in /etc/postgresql/*version*/main/.

.. _user authentication:
   http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/auth-methods.html
.. _general configuration:
   http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/runtime-config.html

Anyway, you create a PostgreSQL user with this::

  $ sudo −u postgres psql
  psql (9.3.4)
  Type "help" for help.

  postgres=# CREATE USER username WITH PASSWORD ’topsecret’ CREATEDB;
  CREATE ROLE
  postgres=# \q

In this snippet, you have to replace ``username`` with your UNIX user name, and
``topsecret`` with a proper password, which shouldn't be your UNIX login
password.  Finally, create the database with::

  $ createdb juliabase


Django
=========

A certain version of JuliaBase works only with a certain version of Django.
Currently, this is Django 1.7.  Install it according to `Django's own
instructions`_.  Not further configuration is necessary.

JuliaBase
===========================

Currently, JuliaBase is organised in a non-public `Git`_ repository.
It contains three Django apps:

1. jb_common
2. samples
3. jb_institute

“jb_common” implements the basic JuliaBase functionality.  On top of that,
“samples” implements the actual samples database.  And on top of that,
“jb_institute” implements code that is specific to the specific institution or
department or work group that wants to use JuliaBase.  jb_institute implements
a *generic* institute.  You will replace jb_institute with your own app and
rename it accordingly.

.. _Git: http://git-scm.com/

Once you have arranged with the `JuliaBase maintainers`_ read access for the
Git repository, you can check out the source code on your computer with::

  git clone git@bob.ipv.kfa-juelich.de:juliabase

.. _JuliaBase maintainers: mailto:m.goblet@fz-juelich.de
.. _manage.py as known from Django:
   https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/


Apache
==========

Add to your Apache configuration something like the following::

  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName juliabase.example.com
    WSGIScriptAlias / /home/username/myproject/mysite/wsgi.py
    XSendFile on
    XSendFilePath /
    Alias /media /var/www/juliabase/media
    <Location "/">
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
      Require all granted
    </Location>
  </VirtualHost>

This snippet contains several parts that highly probably need to be adjusted by
you, in particular ``juliabase.example.com``, ``username``, and all paths in
general.  But this should be obvious.  The proper place for it depends on your
Linux variant.  It may be the (new) file ``/etc/apache2/httpd.conf``, or a new
file in ``/etc/apache2/conf.d``, or a new file in
``/etc/apache2/sites-available`` with a symlink in
``/etc/apache2/sites-enabled``.
