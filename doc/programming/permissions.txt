.. index:: permissions

=====================
Model permissions
=====================

Permissions defined in the ``Meta`` class of models are used in Django to
define user permissions connected with this model.  JuliaBase also makes use of
this permissions framework.  There are, however, some peculiarities to be taken
into account when defining model permissions for JuliaBase model classes.


Semantics and conventions
==============================

For models derived from :py:class:`~samples.models.PhysicalProcess`, there are
four permissions with a special meaning to JuliaBase.  Their codenames must
follow the following naming conventions so that they have effect.

.. index::
   pair: process; unfinished

:samp:`add_{classname}`
      Means that a user is allowed to add new processes, and to edit unfinished
      processes.
:samp:`edit_permissions_for_{classname}`
      Means that a user is allowed to edit the permissions of other users for
      this process class.
:samp:`view_every_{classname}`
      Means that a user is allowed to view all processes.  In particular, such
      users are allowed to read the lab notebook.
:samp:`change_{classname}`
      Means that a user is allowed to edit *all* processes.

Further rules:

- :samp:`{classname}` must be given in lowercase letters without underscores.
- If a user has the permission :samp:`add_{classname}`, this user can edit
  processes he/she is the operator of.
- You can view processes of samples that you can view.
- For obvious reasons, the :samp:`edit_permissions_for_{classname}` permission
  implies all the others.  Usually, the users in charge of this setup or
  apparatus have this permission.


Example
-------

The following code snipped defines the permissions for the
:py:class:`~institute.models.ClusterToolDeposition`::

    class Meta(samples.models.PhysicalProcess.Meta):
        _ = lambda x: x
        permissions = (("add_clustertooldeposition", _("Can add cluster tool depositions")),
                       ("edit_permissions_for_clustertooldeposition",
                       # Translators: Don't abbreviate "perms" in translation
                       # (not even to English)
                        _("Can edit perms for cluster tool I depositions")),
                       ("view_every_clustertooldeposition",
                        _("Can view all cluster tool depositions")),
                       ("change_clustertooldeposition",
                        _("Can edit all cluster tool depositions")))

The :samp:`_ = lambda x: x` trick enables you to mark the permission names
translatable without really translating them here, which wouldn't work.  The
English names are stored in the database backend.  When they are retrieved,
they are translated.


Omitting permissions
=======================

You may define all four permissions above.  However, if you omit some of them,
this has influence on JuliaBase's treatment of that process class.  The obvious
effect of omitting a permission is that no user can have that permission.  But
there are also more subtle effects.

If you omit the ``add_...`` permission, *every* user is allowed to add such a
process.  This may be suitable for things like specimen tempering, etching, or
thickness measurements that are not bound to a specific apparatus.

If you omit the ``edit_permissions_for_...`` permission, the process class will
not appear in the :ref:`“Permissions to processes” <Permissions to processes>`
page.  Moreover, no email is sent to a person in charge of the setup if a user
creates his/her very first process of that kind.


Django's default permissions
===============================

By default, Django generates an ``add_...``, ``change_...``, and ``delete_...``
permission for every model.  You can switch it off for a certain model by
saying

::

   class Meta:
       default_permissions = ()

For physical processes, this has been done already — this is the reason why we
derived our ``Meta`` class from ``samples.models.PhysicalProcess.Meta`` in the
above `Example`_.

We recommend you to switch off Django's default permissions globally for your
project.  This way, it's much easier to control which permissions exist for a
certain model.  You switch them off by saying in your :file:`manage.py`::

   import django.contrib.auth.management
   def _get_only_custom_permissions(opts, ctype):
       return list(opts.permissions)
   django.contrib.auth.management._get_all_permissions = _get_only_custom_permissions
