Settings reference
==================


General JuliaBase settings
============================

DEBUG_EMAIL_REDIRECT_USERNAME
-------------------------------------------

Default: ``""`` (Empty string)

Username of a user to which all outgoing email should be sent if the Django
setting ``DEBUG=True``.  If this name is invalid, in particular if it is empty,
no emails are sent at all in debugging mode.  This prevents embarrassment
caused by emails sent to other people while merely debugging your code.


JAVASCRIPT_I18N_APPS
---------------------------

Default: ``("django.contrib.auth", "samples", "jb_common")``

Tuple containing all apps which contain translations that should be used in
JavaScript code.  The apps are named as in the Django setting
``INSTALLED_APPS``.  See the `Django documentation
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/translation/#internationalization-in-javascript-code>`_
for further information.


TESTING
----------

Default: ``True`` if testing, ``False`` otherwise

If this setting is ``True``, we are currently testing JuliaBase, i.e. it was
started with::

    ./manage.py test {app_name}

This setting is deprecated and will be removed in the future.  Do not use it in
your own code.


USE_X_SENDFILE
--------------------

Default: ``False``

If ``True``, JuliaBase assumes that the web server is interpreting the
``X-Sendfile`` header and serves a static file (e.g. an image) itself.
Otherwise, JuliaBase serves the file, which may be slower and more
time-consuming.  In most cases, it doesn't matter, though.


Settings for LDAP
===================

ADDITIONAL_LDAP_USERS
------------------------------

Default: ``{}`` (Empty dict)

Distionary mapping user names to JuliaBase department names.  This contains
users that are in the LDAP directory but are not in one of the departments
listed in the setting `AD_LDAP_DEPARTMENTS`_ explained below.  The use case is
that some people working in the organization but not in the department(s) may
still be eligible for database access.  By putting them in
``ADDITIONAL_LDAP_USERS``, they are allowed to login.  They are associated with
the department they are mapped to.


AD_LDAP_ACCOUNT_FILTER
--------------------------------

Default: ``"(!(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2))"``

LDAP filter for filtering LDAP members that are eligible for JuliaBase access.
The default filter finds any member which is not inactive.


AD_LDAP_DEPARTMENTS
-----------------------------

Default: ``{}`` (Empty dict)

Dictionary mapping LDAP department names to JuliaBase department names.  If
your LDAP directory data sets contain the "department" attribute, this setting
determines which department get access to chantal.  If this setting is empty,
all LDAP members get access.

If the LDAP doesn't contain the "department" attribute, this setting should be
empty.


AD_LDAP_URLS
------------------

Default: ``()`` (Empty tuple)

List of URLs of LDAP directories.  If you want to use LDAP, this must contain
at least one URL.  It may contain more if there are multiple redundent LDAP
servers.  In this case, JuliaBase will try each of them until it finds a
working one.  An example value may be::

    AD_LDAP_URLS = ["ldaps://dc-e01.ad.mycompany.com:636"]

Here, 636 is the port number of LDAP-over-TLS.


AD_SEARCH_DN
------------------

AD_SEARCH_FIELDS
-----------------------

AD_USERNAME_TEMPLATE
-----------------------

Default: ``"{username}"``

This pattern is used to bind to (a.k.a. login into) the LDAP server.
``{username}`` is replaced by the username of the user that tries to login into
JuliaBase.  A typical value for this setting is

::

   AD_USERNAME_TEMPLATE = "{username}@mycompany.com"


PERMISSIONS_OF_AD_GROUPS
-----------------------------------

Default: ``{}`` (Empty dict)

Dictionary mapping LDAP group names to sets of Django permission names.  Use
the Django ``codename`` of the permission, without any app label.  An example
might be::

    PERMISSIONS_OF_AD_GROUPS = {
            "TG_IEF-5_teamleaders": {"view_all_samples", "adopt_samples",
                                     "edit_permissions_for_all_physical_processes",
                                     "add_external_operator",
                                     "view_all_external_operators", "can_edit_all_topics"}
        }

Note that you should not change permissions in JuliaBase's admin interface that
occur in ``PERMISSIONS_OF_AD_GROUPS``.  They will be overwritten during the
next synchronization with the LDAP directory (in particular, at next user
login).  Consider these permissions being managed exclusively automatically.
