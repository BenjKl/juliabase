Installation
==============

Prerequisites
===============

Basically, you only need he current version of the `Django web framework`_
together with its prerequisites.  Typically, this will be a computer with a
Linux operating system, and with Apache and PostgreSQL running on it.  However,
Django is flexible.  Is also runs on a Windows server, and it may be combined
with different webservers and database backends.  See `Django's own
installation guide`_ for more information.  Still, in this document, we assume
the default setup, which we also strongly recommend: Linux, Apache, PostgreSQL.

By the way, the computer should be a `high-availability system`_, possibly
realised with virtual machines.  In our own installation, we manage a
three-nines system, i.e. 99.9% availability.  To set up such a beast, however,
is beyond the scope of this document.  Your IT department may turn out to be
very helpful with this.

Setting up the source code
===========================

Currently, Chantal is organised in `Git`_ repositories.  There are three of
them:

1. chantal_common
2. chantal_samples
3. chantal_institute

Each of these three repositories contains one Django app of the same name.
chantal_common implements the basic Chantal functionality.  On top of that,
chantal_samples implements the actual samples database.  And on top of that,
chantal_institute implements code that is specific to the specific institution
or department or work group that wants to use Chantal.  chantal_institute
implements a *generic* institute.  You will replace chantal_institute with your
own app and rename it accordingly.
