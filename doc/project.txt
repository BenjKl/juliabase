Short project history
======================

JuliaBase was started in 2008 in one institute of the Forschungszentrum Jülich
under the name of “Chantal” by Torsten Bronger.  In 2009, Marvin Goblet was
hired as a full-time programmer for Chantal.  In 2013/14, three further
institutes in Jülich created Chantal deployments, and with them, further
programmers joined the team.  The core of the source code was separated from
the institute-specific parts and re-branded as “JuliaBase”.  This name is
derived from *Iuliacum*, the Latin name of Jülich, where JuliaBase was
contrived.
