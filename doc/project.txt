Short project history
======================

JuliaBase was started in 2008 in one institute of the Forschungszentrum Jülich
under the name of “Chantal” by T. Bronger.  In 2009, Marvin Goblet joined the
team as a full-time payed programmer.  In 2013/14, three further institutes in
Jülich created Chantal deployments, and with them, further programmers joined
the team.  The core of the source code was separated from the
institute-specific parts and re-branded as “JuliaBase”.
