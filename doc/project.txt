The JuliaBase project
=======================

JuliaBase is an open-source project in the spirit of Free Software.  As such,
its community is equally open.  Our first goal is to have a large community of
people adapting JuliaBase to their institutions.  While working with
JuliaBase's source code, these people will probably make improvements.  Our
second goal is to encourage everyone to contribute these improvements to the
public JuliaBase code.  This way, everyone can benefit from the improvements of
everyone else!

The home of JuliaBase is its `home page`_.  The domain name “juliabase.org” is
registered to Torsten Bronger.  However, the content of the home page,
including all logos, is part of JuliaBase's source code and licenced as Free
Software.  The current maintainer of JuliaBase is Torsten Bronger,
bronger@physik.rwth-aachen.de.  The home page as well as the demo site is
hosted on a server owned by Bronger.

.. _`home page`: http://www.juliabase.org

- Most importantly, JuliaBase's full source code is organised as a `public
  source code repository`_.
- We have a public `mailing list`_ at GoogleGroups.  This is both for
  discussions about the development process as well as general questions.  We
  recommend that you subscribe to this list before sending emails to it.  (You
  don't need a Google account for this.  Ask the maintainer if you have
  questions.)
- For Usenet fans, this mailing list is also available on Gmane as a
  `newsgroup`_.
- On irc.freenode.net is our IRC chat room called #juliabase.

Short project history
======================

JuliaBase was started in 2008 in one institute of the Forschungszentrum Jülich
under the name of “Chantal”.  At this time, it was a one-man project of
T. Bronger.  In 2009, Marvin Goblet joined the team as a full-time payed
programmer.  In 2014, three further institutes in Jülich created Chantal
deployments, and with them, further programmers joined the team.  The core of
the source code was separated from the institute-specific parts and rebranded
as “JuliaBase”.
