=======================
The JuliaBase project
=======================

JuliaBase is an open-source project in the spirit of Free Software.  As such,
its community is equally open.  Our first goal is to have a large community of
people adapting JuliaBase to their institutions.  While working with
JuliaBase's source code, these people will probably make improvements.  Our
second goal is to encourage everyone to contribute these improvements to the
public JuliaBase code.  This way, everyone can benefit from the improvements of
everyone else!

The home of JuliaBase is its `home page`_.  The domain name “juliabase.org” is
registered to Torsten Bronger.  However, the content of the home page,
including all logos, is part of JuliaBase's source code and licensed as Free
Software.  The current maintainer of JuliaBase is Torsten Bronger,
bronger@physik.rwth-aachen.de.  The home page as well as the demo site is
hosted on a server owned by Bronger.

.. _`home page`: http://www.juliabase.org

- Most importantly, JuliaBase's full source code is organized as a `public
  source code repository`_.
- Also on GitHub is our `bug and feature tracker`_.
- We have a public `mailing list`_ at GoogleGroups.  This is both for
  discussions about the development process as well as general questions.  We
  recommend that you subscribe to this list before sending emails to it.  (You
  don't need a Google account for this.  Ask the maintainer if you have
  questions.)
- For Usenet fans, this mailing list is also available on Gmane as a
  `newsgroup`_.
- On irc.freenode.net is our IRC chat room called #juliabase.

The following files, however, are distributed under the terms of the less
strict `GNU General Public License`_ (GPL):

- The top-level files :file:`settings.py`, :file:`wsgi.py`, :file:`manage.py`,
  :file:`urls.py`, and :file:`log.py`
- All files below :file:`institute/` (the “institute” app)

Finally, the “six” module and the “mimeparse” module are distributed under
their own terms stated at the start of the respective file.


What does this mean?
--------------------

It effectively means:

1. You can download, run, and modify JuliaBase freely.
2. You can use all files that serve as examples (in particular, the “institute”
   app) as a starting point for your adaption of JuliaBase.
3. You can offer a JuliaBase web service in your institute, company, or
   whatever, as long as you also offer the JuliaBase source code, including
   your modifications, for download for your users.  You can fulfill this
   requirement by contributing your modifications to the JuliaBase project.
4. The GPL ensures that you do *not* need to offer the files of (2.) for
   download or to contribute them, as they may contain confidential material.
   Besides, they will change often, so it would be a hassle.

This rather elaborate licensing is done in order to have maximal convenience
and flexibility for people who adapt and use JuliaBase, while strongly
encourage them to contribute improvements of JuliaBase itself back to the
community at large.

*Thus, have fun using JuliaBase behind closed doors, but if you improve it,
please send patches to the JuliaBase maintainers so that everyone benefits.
Thank you!*

Short project history
======================

JuliaBase was started in 2008 in one institute of the Forschungszentrum Jülich
under the name of “Chantal”.  At this time, it was a one-man project of
T. Bronger.  In 2009, Marvin Goblet joined the team as a full-time payed
programmer.  In 2014, three further institutes in Jülich created Chantal
deployments, and with them, further programmers joined the team.  The core of
the source code was separated from the institute-specific parts and re-branded
as “JuliaBase”.
