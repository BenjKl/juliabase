Introduction
=============

Your scientific institute or working group creates lots of samples, and your
team needs a tool to keep track of them?  JuliaBase is made for exactly that!
It offers:

- intuitive browser-based interface, fully working even on mobile devices
- maximal flexibility for being adapted perfectly to your production and
  measurement setups, and to your workflows
- possibility to manage more than one department in a single database
- fine-grained access control
- keeps track of samples across sample splits
- support for pre-evaluating raw data and creating plots
- automatic notification of changes in your samples
- sample management by sample series, topics, and tags
- arbitrarily complex searches made easy, e.g. “find all samples with infrared
  measurements, deposited together with a sample on glass substrate with a
  conductivity greater than 10⁻⁶ S/cm; oh yes, and only from this year and made
  by John”
- export to spreadsheets
- automatic lab notebooks
- database interaction from own programs, e.g. for connecting your measurement
  setup directly to the database
- fully translatable; core is available in English and German so far
- fully brandable; adjust the look to your corporate identity and/or your taste
- mature codebase
- compliance with state-of-the-art Web standards and security considerations
- fully open source

We believe that the database should adapt to the people and the existing
workflows rather than the other way round!

However, there is no free lunch … JuliaBase's flexibility comes at a cost.  You
have to create the Python code to define how it should behave for you.  Mostly,
this is copy, paste, and modify.  JuliaBase contains code for typical
processing and measurement setups that you can use as a starting point.


Technical overview
======================

For better evaluation, here is a short list of the technical aspects of
JuliaBase:

- JuliaBase is built on top of the `Django web framework`_.
- JuliaBase is written 100% in the Python programming language (version 2.7 or
  3.2 onward).
- Although other setups are possible, the easiest server installation bases on
  Linux, PostgreSQL, and Apache.
- Hardware requirements are very low; a 100 people institute could be served by
  a single ordinary desktop computer.

Getting started
====================

If you want to give JuliaBase a try, visit the :doc:`demo site <demo>`.  If you
like it, the next step could be :doc:`installing it
</programming/installation>`.  Its installation includes the demo site, so you
have immediately something up and running, and you can evaluate it even better.

If you consider actually using JuliaBase, have a look at the :doc:`programming
guide <programming/programming>` for how to adapt it to your needs.
