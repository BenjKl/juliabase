=======================
The demo site
=======================

At https://demo.juliabase.org, a demo of JuliaBase is installed so that you can
play with it a little bit.  You can log in with various accounts with different
levels of permissions, add samples, processes, tasks etc., have a look at
sample data sheets or a lab notebook, and much more.

However, since this site is accessable to everyone, it may become chaotic over
time.  In order to prevent that, all the data is resetted every hour on the
hour.  So, don't be suprised if you have to log in again after some time – all
session data is resetted, too.  There is nothing to worry though as you may log
in as often as you wish.

This demo site is also the default target of the remote client code shipped
with JuliaBase.  You are encouraged to use the demo as a test bed for your
client code.


The demo accounts
=====================

The demo site is the JuliaBase installation of the “Institute of Nifty New
Materials” (INM).  It's a very small institute with only six employees.  All
accounts have the password “12345”.


The boss
--------

**Jean Renard** (s.renard) is the lead scientist and director of this
institute.  Accordingly, his JuliaBase account allows him to view all samples.
Moreover, he can set permissions of all of the institute's setups, and change
memberships for topics.  Finally, he is the only person that can approve or
reject so-called “sample claims”.  More about this later.


The technical staff
-------------------

**Nick Burkhardt** is a technician in the INM for a very long time.  He is
responsible for the *PDS setup* (photothermal deflection spectroscopy), a
measurement setup.  He performs measurements for researchers.  He would never
let another person use his PDS.

**Hank Griffin** is also a technician.  He is responsible for the
*solarsimulator*, another measurement setup.  He performs measurements for
researchers, but after proper instructions by him, other people may use the
apparatus, too.

**Eddie Monroe** is a depositeur.  This is a technician who manages a
deposition system, in his case, the *cluster tool deposition*.  Here too, other
institute members may use this system after proper instructions.

The scientific staff
--------------------

**Rosalee Calvert** is a tenure scientist and creates samples by herself in the
*5-chamber deposition setup*.  Currently, she's the only one using this setup.
Afterwards, she measures the samples in the solarsimulator.  His current
project is a cooperation with the University of Paris.

**Juliette Silverton** is a PhD student with a lot of work.  Thus, she is
unable to do sample preparation and measurements herself, and let others do it.
Consequently, she makes intensive use of JuliaBase's “task lists” feature in
order to commission the work.


First steps
===========


The “My Samples” list
---------------------

Log in as ``r.calvert``.  In the main menu, you can see Rosalee's “My Samples”
on the right hand side.  This list usually contains not *all* samples of a user
but only those that are *currently of interest* to him/her.  Still, this list
may become quite long, and is therefore structured by *topics* and *sample
series*.  You may click on the bullet icons in the list to fold and unfold
sections that you want to hide.


Topics
------

One sample usually belongs to exactly one topic.  This helps to organize
samples.  For one thing, one can give topics expressive names, which makes the
samples' purpose clear.  But even more important is that topics define who can
see the sample.

The most important rule in JuliaBase is: *You can only see samples of your
topics.*

If a sample is in no topic, it is completely unprotected.  Everyone can see it
and take possession of it.  There may be use cases for that but usually, you
should put all your samples in topics.

People can be in an arbitrary lot of topics at the same time, but a sample is
in exactly one topic.  It may change it during its lifetime, though.  Senior
team members may have the permission to see all samples, whether in their
topics or not.  Jean Renard is such a person.

Jean also has the permission to change topic memberships of all topics, and to
add new topics.
