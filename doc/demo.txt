===========================
A walk through JuliaBase
===========================

The demo site
===============

At https://demo.juliabase.org, a demo of JuliaBase is installed so that you can
play with it a little bit.  You can log in with various accounts with different
levels of permissions, add samples, processes, tasks etc., have a look at
sample data sheets or a lab notebook, and much more.

However, since this site is accessable to everyone, it may become chaotic over
time.  In order to prevent that, all the data is resetted every hour on the
hour.  So, don't be suprised if you have to log in again after some time – all
session data is resetted, too.  There is nothing to worry though as you may log
in as often as you wish.

This demo site is also the default target of the remote client code shipped
with JuliaBase.  You are encouraged to use the demo as a test bed for your
client code.


The demo accounts
=====================

The demo site is the JuliaBase installation of the “Institute of Nifty New
Materials” (INM).  It's a very small institute with only six employees.  All
accounts have the password “12345”.


The boss
--------

**Jean Renard** (s.renard) is the lead scientist and director of this
institute.  Accordingly, his JuliaBase account allows him to view all samples,
but he has got other privileges, too.  More about that later.


The technical staff
-------------------

**Nick Burkhardt** (n.burkhardt) is a technician in the INM for a very long time.  He is
responsible for the *PDS setup* (photothermal deflection spectroscopy), a
measurement setup.  He performs measurements for researchers.  He would never
let another person use his PDS.

**Hank Griffin** (h.griffin) is also a technician.  He is responsible for the
*solarsimulator*, another measurement setup.  He performs measurements for
researchers, but after proper instructions by him, other people may use the
apparatus, too.

**Eddie Monroe** (e.monroe) is a depositeur.  This is a technician who manages
a deposition system, in his case, the *cluster tool deposition*.  Here too,
other institute members may use this system after proper instructions.


The scientific staff
--------------------

**Rosalee Calvert** (r.calvert) is a tenure scientist and creates samples by
herself in the *5-chamber deposition setup*.  Currently, she's the only one
using this setup.  Afterwards, she measures the samples in the solarsimulator.
His current project is a cooperation with the University of Paris.

**Juliette Silverton** (j.silverton) is a PhD student with a lot of work.
Thus, she is unable to do sample preparation and measurements herself, and let
others do it.  Consequently, she makes intensive use of JuliaBase's “task
lists” feature in order to commission the work.


Rosalee: The everyday work
==============================

   :scale: 50%

Log in as ``r.calvert``, the typical ordinary user.  We will see how she gets
her work done.


The “My Samples” list
---------------------

In the main menu, you can see Rosalee's “My Samples” on the right hand side.
This list usually contains not *all* samples of a user but only those that are
*currently of interest* to him/her.  Still, this list may become quite long,
and is therefore structured by *topics* and *sample series*.  You may click on
the bullet icons in the list to fold and unfold sections that you want to hide.


Topics
------

One sample usually belongs to exactly one topic.  This helps to organize
samples.  For one thing, one can give topics expressive names, which makes the
samples' purpose clear.  In Rosalee's list, all samples belong to the topic
“Cooperation with Paris University”.

But even more important is that topics define who can see the sample.  The
prime directive in JuliaBase is: *You can only see samples of your topics.*

If a sample is in no topic, it is completely unprotected.  Everyone can see it
and take possession of it.  There may be use cases for that but usually, you
should put all your samples in topics.

People can be in an arbitrary lot of topics at the same time, but a sample is
in exactly one topic.  It may change it during its lifetime, though.  Senior
team members may have the permission to see all samples, whether in their
topics or not.  Jean Renard is such a person.


Sample data sheet
-----------------

.. image:: images/ss_datasheet.png
   :alt: Sample data sheet screenshot
   :align: right
   :scale: 50%

Let's visit a sample by clicking on “14S-001”.  You see its data sheet.  At the
top, it contains some general information like the currently responsible person
and the topic.  Then, you see a list of everything that has been done with this
sample, in chronological order.  It starts with the substrate, is continued
with the deposition of the silicon layers, and ends with a measurement in the
solar simulator.

Every such step is called a “process” in JuliaBase.  Even the “Substrate” is a
process, albeit a slightly odd one.  Every process has an operator and a
timestamp.  You can fold processes that would otherwise clobber the data sheet
by clicking on the heading.

The main work when adapting JuliaBase to a new institute is programming all the
processes that the institute needs.  The solarsimulator measurement at the
bottom is a good example why it is worth the effort.  Just click on the colored
squares, and you see how the data and the plot change immediately.  Such
features are lacking in off-the-shelf databases.  This high degree of
adaptability and flexibility is the primary strength of JuliaBase.

Let's scroll back to the top.  You see a schematic cross section of the sample,
called an “informal stack” because it may not be totally accurate.  This is not
part of JuliaBase's core because it may not be useful for every institute.  But
it's part of the source code and you may use it.  If you click on it, you get
it as a PDF.  This is also true for all plots in JuliaBase.


Edit samples
------------

You can edit a sample by clicking on the pencil icon next to the sample's
name.  “Editing a sample” refers *only* to the data at the top of the data
sheet.  In particular, no processes are affected.  Very often when you change
somethin in JuliaBase, you have to describe your changes shortly at the bottom
right.  It may be tedious sometimes, but it may be very helpful to others who
get notified by your changes.


Add processes
-------------

Also on the top of the sample data sheet there is the gear icon, which is to
append a new process to the sample.  If you click on it, you are asked which
kind of process you'd like to add.  Let's have a look at two possibilities:
Splitting and result process.


Split a sample
..............

Depending on your workflow, it may happen a lot that you split samples into
pieces.
