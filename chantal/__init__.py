u"""This is Chantal, the samples database of the IEF-5 / Jülich Research
Centre.

In order to understand its source code, I recomment you start reading the
“models” module to become familiar with the database object we deal with here.
Then, you should read “samples.views.main” and
“samples.views.six_chamber_depositon” to get an overview of the views (i.e. the
web pages) in Chantal.  You may look at the templates_ as well, however, they
are only available in the source code because they are HTML and not Python.
