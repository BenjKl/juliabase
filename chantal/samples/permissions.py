u"""Central permission checking.  This module consists of three parts: First,
the exceptions that are raised if a certain permission condition is not met.
Secondly, the assertion functions that test for certain permissions.  And
thirdly, top-level code that generates a ``has_permission_to_...`` function for
every ``assert_can_...`` function.

The idea is the following.  For example, there is a function called
``assert_can_view_sample``.  If the user can't view the sample, a
``PermissionViewSampleError`` is raised.  Sometimes however, you just want to
check it without having to catch an exception.  Then, you use
``has_permission_to_view_sample``.  The parameters are the same but instead of
raising an exception, it returns ``True`` or ``False``.

The ``assert_can_...`` function are typically used at the beginning of views
where permissions need to be checked and every failure means an error.  By
contrast, the ``has_permission_to_...`` functions are used where a missing
permission just means that e.g. a link is not generated (for example, in the
``get_additional_template_context`` methods in the models).

class PermissionError(Exception):
    u"""Common base class for all permission exceptions.  It should never be
    instantiated itself.

    Note that I store much in instance attributes.  For example, the user whose
    permissions are not enough should be the currently logged-in user anyway,
    so it seems to be superfluous to store it in an attribute, too.  The sample
    is true for ``message`` (generated by calling the inherited contructor) and
    some attributes stored by derived classes.  However, you never know, and I
    like fat exception objects.

    :ivar decription: the full description of what failed.  It should be a
      complete sentence, which addresses the user directly.  It should start
      with a capital letter and end with a full stop.  For example, it may
      contain ``"You are not allowed to view sample 01B-410."``.

      Typically, this is generated by the exception's class constructor.
      However, the class constructor only generates a *partial* phrase which is
      then embedded into a pattern sentence in `PermissionError.__init__`.

    :ivar reason: the full reason why the permission was missing.  It should be
      a complete sentence, starting with a capital letter and ending with a
      full stop.  It should address the user directly.  For example, it may
      contain ``"You are not in group “SiC”."``.  Avoid giving more information
      here than the user is allowed to know.  Typically, this is generated by
      the assertion function.

        complete sentence.  The embracing string for English is ``"You are not
        allowed to <partial_description>."``.  For other languages it may
        differ.  The partial description must fit into it, e.g., it may be
