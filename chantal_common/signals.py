"""Module for providing the JuliaBase signals.

:ivar maintain: This is sent in regular time intervals (e.g., every night), so
  that various subsystems can use it for maintenance work.  You can use this
  signal in your code like this::

      from chantal_common.signals import maintain
      from django.dispatch import receiver

      @receiver(maintain)
      def my_handler(sender, **kwargs):
          ...


:ivar storage_changed: This is sent if the files on harddisk were changed.  In
  the reference deployment at IEK-5, this signal is used for triggering
  sychronisation of both nodes.
