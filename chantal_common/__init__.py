u"""Module for hooks into the ``User`` model.  They assure that every time a
user is added, ``UserDetails`` are added.

Additionally, there is a hook to purge too old error pages.

The error codes for a JSON client are the following:

    ======= ===============================================
    code    description
    ======= ===============================================
    1       Web form error
    2       URL not found, i.e. HTTP 404
    3       GET/POST parameter missing
    4       user could not be authenticated
    5       GET/POST parameter invalid
    ======= ===============================================
