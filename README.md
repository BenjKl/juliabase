Licensing
---------

JuliaBase is Free Software.

- JuliaBase is distributed under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public
  License, see the file COPYING-AGPL.txt.
- JuliaBase-Institute, which consists of the files below the directory
  "institute/" as well as some other files, is distributed under the terms of
  the (less strict) GNU General Public License, see the file COPYING-GPL.txt.
- Some source code files are distributed under their own terms stated at the
  start of the respective file.

It effectively means:

- You can download, run, and modify JuliaBase freely.
- You can use all files that serve as examples (in particular, the “institute”
  app) as a starting point for your adaption of JuliaBase.
- You can offer a JuliaBase web service in your institute, company, or
  whatever, as long as you also offer the JuliaBase source code, including your
  modifications, for download for your users.  IMPORTANT: You need not offer
  your own Django app for download, as it may contain confidential material.

This rather elaborate licensing is done in order to have maximal convenience
and flexibility for people who adapt and use JuliaBase, while strongly
encourage them to contribute improvements of JuliaBase itself back to the
community at large.

So, have fun using JuliaBase behind closed doors, but if you improve it, please
send patches to the JuliaBase maintainers.  This way, every JuliaBase
installation benefits from all improvements made.  Thank you!
